# weekly-schedule-generator

Collection of a few functions to generate recurring weekly events that are
rotated between a group of people.

Example usage is a club house that is cleaned weekly by the members on a
rotating schedule.

[European/ISO weeks are used, they might differ a bit from US
weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date).

The script generates ICS calendar files as well as a CSV file to import into
other tools.

_This is a small script. Use it if you like it, but don't expect much from it._
